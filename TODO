svg:path->DefineShape3 should have proper bounds (use exslt:math:min/max)
sanitizing xslt? 
	swft:check-id() for Define*, check for double ids.
	check for double depth values (?)
	(re-)calulate bounds for DefineShape*, Fonts

DefineShape2/3 many_shapes (>255) *will fail once someone tries*
Header size not as expected since DefineShape2/3 (fixed?)

version attr
eps/svg import?
videoobject/canvas


this is mainly a note to myself as to what to hack on if i get bored.
it's definitely not a promise :)

byte offsets for Branch

sscanf might be a bad idea. use strtoX(), atoX()?
?Writer::putNBitInt sanity check, are n enough bits to represent value?
-make exporting an option
import wav
import mp3
fail more elegantly, make parsing after filesize impossible.
dont load everything to memory, use streams. make it a sax parser/handler?

alexis reference:
	DefineButton2(?) buttons have colortransform
	DefineButton2 has an additional list of actions?
