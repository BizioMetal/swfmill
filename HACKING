this file contains information that might be helpful when browsing swfmills sources for whatever reason.

- the classes to represent SWF elements are generated with XSLT from the file src/xsl/source.xml with
	cd src/
	xsltproc codegen/mk.xsl codegen/source.xml
the resulting code is not well indented, and really the xslt step should be integrated into the makefile.

- the generated base classes are derived from SWFTag, SWFAction, SWFStyle, SWFFilter or (for <type/>s in source.xml) no base class at all (for thngs like "Rectangle"). Fonts are certainly special, both the contents of the DefineFont2 tag (not a "clean", generated class but the SWFGlyphList kludge) as well as freetype handling and conversion to the proper shape definitions.

- the basic I/O code is in SWFFile (for header, compression) and SWFReader/Writer (for anything else, including SWF-style nBit numbers etc.)

- the XSL stylesheet that makes up the "simple" processing mode (which is itself everything but simple) is built in src/xslt/. there's more README there.
