this file contains information that might be helpful when browsing swfmills sources for whatever reason.

- the classes to represent SWF elements are generated with XSLT from the file src/xsl/source.xml with
	cd src/
	xsltproc codegen/mk.xsl codegen/source.xml
the resulting code is not well indented, and really the xslt step should be integrated into the makefile.

- the basic I/O code is in SWFFile (for header, compression) and SWFReader/Writer (for anything else, including SWF-style nBit numbers etc.)
